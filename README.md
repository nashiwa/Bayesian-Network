# Bayesian Network Project

## Overview
This project involves the implementation of a Bayesian Network in Python. It is structured into several key modules, each performing specific functions essential to the operation of the network.

## Files Description
* **bayesian_network.py**: Main file defining the Bayesian Network structure and functionalities. It includes the implementation of the network's core logic.

* **combine_node_basic_function.py**: Contains basic functions used in node combinations within the network. It provides foundational operations for node manipulation.

* **combine_node_multi_output.py**: Handles scenarios where nodes within the network produce multiple outputs. This module ensures proper handling and propagation of these outputs.

* **combine_node_single_output.py**: Focuses on nodes with single outputs. It streamlines the processing and transmission of single-output data across the network.

* **common_function.py**: Includes common functions used across different modules. This file centralizes shared utilities to promote code reuse and maintainability.

* **run_example.py**: An example script demonstrating how to use the Bayesian Network. It provides a practical use case and showcases the network's functionalities.

## Usage
To run the example, simply execute the run_example.py script
* `python run_example.py`

Ensure that all the other Python files are in the same directory as run_example.py for proper functionality.

## Requirements
* Python 3
